Graph theory
------------
* Hall's Theorem
* Planarity
* Cayley's Theorem
* Expand the complexity commentary?

* Pigeonhole Principle (in Ramsey)
* Finite automata (with an eye toward reduction thereof)
* Pólya enumeration
* Möbius Inversion
* Designs and codes
* Expand generating functions (do we want to get into exponential g.f.?)
* Expand recurrence relations to talk about nonhomogeneous case (do we
  want to talk about using generating functions to solve recurrence
  relations?)
* Can we get some applications from biology by talking to Christine
  Heitsch?

<title>The Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms of Set Theory</title>
<p>
In the first part of this appendix,
we put number systems on a firm foundation, but in the
process, we used an intuitive understanding of sets.
Not surprisingly, this approach is fraught with danger. As was first discovered
more than 100 years ago, there are major conceptual hurdles
in formulating consistent systems of axioms for set theory.
And it is very easy to make statements that sound <q>obvious</q>
but are not.
</p>

<p>
Here is one very famous example. Let <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> be
sets and consider the following two
statements:
</p>

<ol>
<li>There exists an injection <m>f:X\rightarrow Y</m>.</li>
<li>There exists a surjection <m>g:Y\rightarrow X</m>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are finite sets, these statements are
equivalent, and it is perhaps natural to surmise that the
same is true when <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are infinite. But that is not
the case.
</p>

<p>
A good source of additional (free) information on set theory is
the collection of Wikipedia articles. Do a web search and
look up the following topics and people:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Zermelo Frankel set theory.</li>
<li>Axiom of Choice.</li>
<li>Peano postulates.</li>
<li>Georg Cantor, Augustus De Morgan, George Boole, Bertrand Russell
and Kurt G&#xf6;del.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Here is the system of axioms popularly known as ZFC, which
is an abbreviation for Zermelo-Frankel plus the Axiom of Choice.
In this system,
the notion of <em>set</em> and the membership operator <m>\in</m>
are undefined. However, if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are sets, then
exactly one of the following statements is true:
(i)<nbsp /><m>A\in B</m> is <em>true</em>; (ii)<nbsp /><m>A\in B</m> is <em>false</em>.
When <m>A\in B</m> is false, we write <m>A\notin B</m>. Also, there
is an equivalence relation <m>=</m> defined on sets.
</p>

<p>
<b>Axiom of extensionality:</b> 
Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements.
</p>

<p>
<b>Axiom of empty set:</b> 
There is a set <m>\emptyset</m> with no elements.
</p>

<p>
<b>Axiom of pairing:</b> 
If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are sets, then there exists a set containing <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>
as its only elements, which we denote by <m>\{x,y\}</m>. Note: If
<m>x=y</m>, then we write only <m>\{x\}</m>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Axiom of union:</b> 
For any set <m>x</m>, there is a set <m>y</m> such that the elements of <m>y</m>
are precisely the elements of the elements of <m>x</m>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Axiom of infinity:</b> 
There exists a set <m>x</m> such that <m>\emptyset\in x</m> and whenever
<m>y\in x</m>, so is <m>\{y ,\{y\}\}</m>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Axiom of power set</b> 
Every set has a power set. That is, for any set <m>x</m>,
there exists a set <m>y</m>, such that the elements of <m>y</m> are
precisely the subsets of<nbsp /><m>x</m>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Axiom of regularity:</b> 
Every non-empty set <m>x</m> contains some element <m>y</m> such that
<m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are disjoint sets.
</p>

<p>
<b>Axiom of separation (or subset axiom):</b> 
Given any set and any proposition <m>P(x)</m>, there is a subset
of the original set containing precisely those elements <m>x</m>
for which <m>P(x)</m> holds.
</p>

<p>
<b>Axiom of replacement:</b> 
Given any set and any mapping, formally defined as a
proposition <m>P(x,y)</m> where <m>P(x,y_1)</m> and <m>P(x,y_2)</m> implies
<m>y_1 = y_2</m>, there is a set containing precisely the images
of the original set's elements.
</p>

<p>
<b>Axiom of choice:</b> 
Given any set of mutually exclusive non-empty sets, there
exists at least one set that contains exactly one element in
common with each of the non-empty sets.

<title>Integer Solutions of Linear Programming Problems</title>
<p>
A linear programming problem is an optimization problem that
can be stated in the following form: Find the maximum
value of a linear function
</p>
<me>
  c_1x_1+c_2x_2+c_3x_3+\dots+c_n x_n
</me>
<p>
subject to <m>m</m> constraints <m>C_1</m>, <m>C_2,\dots,C_m</m>, where
each constraint <m>C_i</m> is a linear equation of the form:
</p>
<me>
  C_i:\quad a_{i1}x_1+a_{i2}x_2+a_{i3}x_3+\dots+a_{in}x_n=b_i
</me>
<p>
where all coefficients and constants are real numbers.

While the general subject of linear programming is far too
broad for this course, we would be remiss if we didn't
point out that:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Linear programming problems are a <em>very</em>
important class of optimization problems and they have
many applications in engineering, science, and industrial settings.</li>
<li>There are relatively efficient algorithms for finding
solutions to linear programming problems.</li>
<li>A linear programming problem posed with rational coefficients
and constants has an optimal solution with rational values<mdash />if it
has an optimal solution at all.</li>
<li>A linear programming problem posed with integer coefficients
and constants need not have an optimal solution with integer values<mdash />even
when it has an optimal solution with rational values.</li>
<li>A very important theme in operations research is to determine
when a linear programming problem posed in integers has an optimal
solution with integer values.  This is a subtle and often very difficult
problem.</li>
<li>The problem of finding a maximum flow in a network is
a special case of a linear programming problem.</li>
<li>A network flow problem in which all capacities are integers
has a maximum flow in which the flow on every edge is an integer.
The Ford-Fulkerson labeling algorithm guarantees this!</li>
<li>In general, linear programming algorithms are not used
on networks.  Instead, special purpose algorithms, such as Ford-Fulkerson,
have proven to be more efficient in practice.</li>

      <biography>
        <title>About William T. Trotter</title>
        <p>William T. Trotter is a Professor in the School of Mathematics at Georgia Tech. He was first exposed to combinatorial mathematics through the 1971 Bowdoin Combinatorics Conference which featured an array of superstars of that era, including Gian Carlo Rota, Paul Erd&#337;s, Marshall Hall, Herb Ryzer, Herb Wilf, William Tutte, Ron Graham, Daniel Kleitman and Ray Fulkerson. Since that time, he has published more than 120 research papers on graph theory, discrete geometry, ramsey theory and extremal combinatorics. Perhaps his best known work is in the area of combinatorics and partially ordered sets, and his 1992 research monograph on this topic has been very influential. (He takes some pride in the fact that this monograph is still in print and copies are being sold in 2016.) He has more than 70 co-authors, but considers his extensive joint work with Graham Brightwell, Stefan Felsner, Peter Fishburn, Hal Kierstead and Endre Szemer√®di as representing his best work. His career includes invited presentations at more than 50 international conferences and more than 30 meetings of professional societies. He was the founding editor of the <em>SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics</em> and has served on the Editorial Board of <em>Order</em> since the journal was launched in 1984, and his service includes an eight year stint as Editor-in-Chief. Currently, he serves on the editorial boards of three other journals in combinatorial mathematics.</p>

        <p>Still he has his quirks. First, he insists on being called <q>Tom</q>, as Thomas is his middle name, while continuing to sign as William T. Trotter. Second, he has invested time and energy serving five terms as department/school chair, one at Georgia Tech, two at Arizona State University and two at the University of South Carolina. In addition, he has served as a Vice Provost and as an Assistant Dean. Third, he is fascinated by computer operating systems and is always installing new ones. In one particular week, he put eleven different flavors of Linux on the same machine, interspersed with four complete installs of Windows<nbsp />7. Incidentally, the entire process started and ended with Windows<nbsp />7. Fourth, he likes to hit golf balls, not play golf, just hit balls. Without these diversions, he might even have had enough time to settle the Riemann hypothesis.</p>
        
        <p>He has had eleven Ph.D. students, one of which is now his co-author on this text.</p>

        <title>About Mitchel T. Keller</title>
        <p>Mitchel T. Keller is a super-achiever (this description is written by WTT) extraordinaire from North Dakota. As a graduate student at Georgia Tech, he won a lengthy list of honors and awards, including a VIGRE Graduate Fellowship, an IMPACT Scholarship, a John R. Festa Fellowship and the 2009 Price Research Award. Mitch is a natural leader and was elected President (and Vice President) of the Georgia Tech Graduate Student Government Association, roles in which he served with distinction. Indeed, after completing his terms, his student colleagues voted to establish a continuing award for distinguished leadership, to be named the Mitchel T. Keller award, with Mitch as the first recipient. Very few graduate students win awards in the first place, but Mitch is the only one I know who has an award <em>named</em> after them.</p>

        <p>Mitch is also a gifted teacher of mathematics, receiving the prestigious Georgia Tech 2008 Outstanding Teacher Award, a campus-wide competition. He is quick to experiment with the latest approaches to teaching mathematics, adopting what works for him while refining and polishing things along the way. He really understands the literature behind active learning and the principles of engaging students in the learning process. Mitch has even taught his more senior (some say ancient) co-author a thing or two and got him to try personal response systems in a large calculus section.</p>

        <p>Mitch is off to a fast start in his own research career, and is already an expert in the subject of linear discrepancy. Mitch has also made substantive contributions to a topic known as Stanley depth, which is right at the boundary of combinatorial mathematics and algebraic combinatorics.</p>

        <p>After finishing his Ph.D., Mitch received another signal honor, a Marshall Sherfield Postdoctoral Fellowship and spent two years at the London School of Economics. He is presently an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Washington and Lee University, and a few years down the road, he'll probably be president of something.</p>

        <p>On the personal side, Mitch is the keeper of the Mathematics Genealogy Project, and he is a great cook. His desserts are to die for.</p>

      <preface>
        <p>At Georgia Tech, MATH 3012: Applied Combinatorics, is a junior-level course targeted primarily at students pursuing the B.S. in Computer Science. The purpose of the course is to give students a broad exposure to combinatorial mathematics, using applications to emphasize fundamental concepts and techniques. Applied Combinatorics is also required of students seeking the B.S. in Applied Mathematics or the B.S in Discrete Mathematics, and it is one of two discrete mathematics courses that computer engineering students may select to fulfill a breadth requirement. The course will also often contain a selection of other engineering and science majors who are interested in learning more mathematics. As a consequence, in a typical semester, some 250 Georgia Tech students are enrolled in Applied Combinatorics. Students enrolled in Applied Combinatorics at Georgia Tech have already completed the three semester calculus sequence<mdash />with many students bypassing one or more of the these courses on the basis of advanced placement scores. Also, the students will know some linear algebra and can at least have a reasonable discussion about vector spaces, bases and dimension.</p>

        <p>Our approach to the course is to show students the beauty of combinatorics and how combinatorial problems naturally arise in many settings, particularly in computer science. While proofs are periodically presented in class, the course is not intended to teach students how to write proofs; there are other required courses in our curriculum that meet this need. Students may occasionally be asked to prove small facts, but these arguments are closer to the kind we expect from students in second or third semester calculus as contrasted with proofs we expect from a mathematics major in an upper-division course. Regardless, we cut very few corners, and our text can readily be used by instructors who elect to be even more rigorous in their approach.</p>

        <p>This book arose from our feeling that a text that met our approach to Applied Combinatorics was not available. Because of the diverse set of instructors assigned to the course, the standard text was one that covered every topic imaginable (and then some), but provided little depth. We've taken a different approach, attacking the central subjects of the course description to provide exposure, but taking the time to go into greater depth in select areas to give the students a better feel for how combinatorics works. We have also included some results and topics that are not found in other texts at this level but help reveal the nature of combinatorics to students. We want students to understand that combinatorics is a subject that you must feel <q>in the gut</q>, and we hope that our presentation achieves this goal. The emphasis throughout remains on applications, including algorithms. We do not get deeply into the details of what it means for an algorithm to be <q>efficient</q>, but we do include an informal discussion of the basic principles of complexity, intended to prepare students in computer science, engineering and applied mathematics for subsequent coursework.</p>

        <p>The materials included in this book have evolved over time. Early versions of a few chapters date from 2004, but the pace quickened in 2006 when the authors team taught a large section of Applied Combinatorics. In the last five years, existing chapters have been updated and expanded, while new chapters have been added. As matters now stand, our book includes more material than we can cover in a single semester. We feel that the topics of Chapters 1<ndash />9 plus Chapters 12, 13 and 14 are the core of a one semester course in Applied Combinatorics. Additional topics can then be selected from the remaining chapters based on the interests of the instructor and students.</p>

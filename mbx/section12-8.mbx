<title>Exercises</title>
<ol>
<li>Our gang of seven (Alice, Bob, Carlos, Dave, Xing, Yolanda and Zori) are
students in a class with a total enrollment of 35.  The professor
chooses three students at random to go to the board to work
challenge problems.
<ol>
<li>What is the probability that Yolanda is chosen?</li>
<li>What is the probability that Yolanda is chosen and Zori is not?</li>
<li>What is the probability that exactly two members of the club are chosen?</li>
<li>What is the probability that none of the seven members of club are chosen?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Bob says to no one in particular, <q>Did you know that the
  probability that you will get at least one ``7</q> in three rolls of a
  pair of dice is slightly less than <m>1/2</m>.  On the other hand, the
  probability that you'll get at least one <q>5</q> in six rolls of the
  dice is just over <m>1/2</m>.''  Is Bob on target, or out to lunch?</li>
<li>Consider the spinner shown in <xref ref="fig_spinner" autoname="yes" /> at the
  beginning of the chapter.
<ol>
<li>What is the probability of getting at least one <q>5</q> in three spins?</li>
<li>What is the probability of getting at least one <q>3</q> in three spins?</li>
<li>If you keep spinning until you get either a <q>2</q> or a <q>5</q>, what is
the probability that you get a <q>2</q> first?</li>
<li>If you receive <m>i</m> dollars when the spinner halts in region<nbsp /><m>i</m>,
what is the expected value?  Since three is right in the middle of the 
possible outcomes, is it reasonable to pay three dollars to play this game?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Alice proposes to Bob the following game.  Bob pays one dollar to play.
Fifty balls marked <m>1,2,\dots,50</m> are placed in a big jar, stirred around,
and then drawn out one by one by Zori, who is wearing a blindfold.  The result
is a random permutation <m>\sigma</m> of the integers <m>1</m>, <m>2,\dots,50</m>.  Bob wins
with a payout of two dollars and fifty cents if the permutation <m>\sigma</m> is 
a derangement, i.e., <m>\sigma(i)\neq i</m> for all <m>i=1,2,\dots,n</m>. Is this a
fair game for Bob?  If not how should the payoff be adjusted to make it fair?</li>
<li>A random graph with vertex set <m>\{1,2,\dots,10\}</m> is constructed by
the following method.  For each two element subset <m>\{i,j\}</m> from <m>\{1,2,\dots,10\}</m>,
a fair coin is tossed and the edge <m>\{i,j\}</m> then belongs to the graph when
the result is <q>heads.</q>  For each <m>3</m>-element subset <m>S\subseteq\{1,2,\dots,n\}</m>,
let <m>E_S</m> be the event that <m>S</m> is a complete subgraph in our random graph.
<ol>
<li>Explain why <m>P(E_S)= 1/8</m> for each <m>3</m>-element subset <m>S</m>.</li>
<li>Explain why <m>E_S</m> and <m>E_T</m> are independent when <m>|S\cap T|\le 1</m>.</li>
<li>Let <m>S=\{1,2,3\}</m>, <m>T=\{2,3,4\}</m> and <m>U=\{3,4,5\}</m>.  Show that
<m>P(E_S|E_T)\neq P(E_S|E_TE_U)</m>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Ten marbles labeled <m>1,2,\dots,10</m> are placed in a big jar and
  then stirred up.  Zori, wearing a blindfold, pulls them out of the
  jar two at a time.  Players are allowed to place bets as to whether
  the sum of the two marbles in a pair is <m>11</m>.  There are <m>C(10,2)=
  45</m> different pairs and exactly <m>5</m> of these pairs sums to eleven.

  Suppose Zori draws out a pair; the results are observed; then
  she returns the two balls to the jar and all ten balls are stirred
  before the next sample is taken.  Since the probability that the sum
  is an <q>11</q> is <m>5/45=1/9</m>, then it would be fair to pay one dollar
  to play the game if the payoff for an <q>11</q> is nine dollars.
  Similarly, the payoff for a wager of one hundred dollars should be
  nine hundred dollars.

  Now consider an alternative way to play the game.  Now Zori
  draws out a pair; the results are observed; and the marbles are set
  aside.  Next, she draws another pair from the remaining eight
  marbles, followed by a pair selected from the remaining six, etc.
  Finally, the fifth pair is just the pair that remains after the
  fourth pair has been selected.  Now players may be free to wager on
  the outcome of any or all or just some of the five rounds.  Explain
  why either everyone should or no one should wager on the fifth round.
  Accordingly, the last round is skipped and all marbles are returned
  to the jar and we start over again.

  Also explain why an observant player can make lots of money with a payout
  ratio of nine to one.  Now for a more challenging problem, what is
  the minimum payout ratio above which a player has a winning
  strategy?</li>

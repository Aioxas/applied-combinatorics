<title>Inclusion-Exclusion</title><introduction>
<p>
In this chapter, we study a classic enumeration technique known as
Inclusion-Exclusion. In its simplest case, it is absolutely intuitive.
Its power rests in the fact that in many situations, we start with an
exponentially large calculation and see it reduce to a manageable
size. We focus on three applications that every student of
combinatorics should know: (1)<nbsp />counting surjections, (2)<nbsp />derangements,
and (3)<nbsp />the Euler <m>\phi</m>-function.

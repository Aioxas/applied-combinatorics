<title>Exercises</title><ol><li>Consider a random graph with vertex set <m>\{1,2,\dot,n\}</m>.
If the edge probability is <m>p=1/2</m>, then let <m>X</m> denote the number
of complete subgraphs is size <m>t=2\log n</m> and let <m>Y</m> denote the
number of independent sets of size <m>t=2\log n</m>.
<ol><li>Show that <m>E(X+Y)\lt 1</m>, when <m>n</m> is sufficiently large.</li>
<li>Use the result from part<nbsp />a to show that <m>\omega(G)</m> is less
than <m>2\log n</m>, while the chromatic number of <m>G</m> is at least <m>n/(2\log n)</m>
(both statements holding with high probability).  As a result, the basic
inequality <m>\chi(G)\ge\omega(G)</m> is far from being tight for a random
graph.</li>
 </ol> </li>
<li>We form a random tournament as follows.  Start with a complete graph 
with vertex set <m>\{1,2,\dots,n\}</m>.  For each distinct
pair <m>i</m>, <m>j</m> with <m>1\le i\lt j\le n</m>, flip a fair coin.  If the result is heads,
orient the edge from <m>i</m> to <m>j</m>, which we denote by <m>(x,y)</m>.  If the toss is
tails, then the edge is oriented from <m>j</m> to <m>i</m>, denoted <m>(y,x)</m>.
Show that when <m>n</m> is large, with high probability, the following 
statement is true: For every set <m>S</m> of size <m>\log n/10</m>, there is a vertex 
<m>x</m> so that <m>(x,y)</m> in <m>T</m> for every <m>y\in S</m>.</li>
<li>Let <m>T</m> be a random tournament on <m>n</m> vertices.  Show that with
high probability, the following statement is true: For every pair <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>
of distinct vertices, either (1)<nbsp /><m>(x,y)</m> in <m>T</m>, or (2)<nbsp />there is a vertex
<m>z</m> for which both <m>(x,z)</m> and <m>(z,y)</m> are in <m>T</m>.</li>
<li>Many statements for random graphs exhibit a threshold behavior.
Show that a random graph with edge probability <m>p=10\log n/n</m> almost
certainly has no isolated vertices, while a random graph with edge probability 
<m>p=\log n/(10 n)</m> almost certainly has at least one isolated vertices.</li>
<li>In the sense of the preceding problem, determine the threshold probability
for a graph to be connected.</li>

<title>Exercises</title>
<p>
Computer algebra systems can be powerful tools for working with
generating functions. In addition to stand-alone applications that run
on your computer, the free website Wolfram<m>|</m>Alpha
(\url{http://www.wolframalpha.com}) is capable of finding general
forms of some power series representations and specific coefficients
for many more. However, unless an exercise specifically suggests that
you use a computer algebra system, we strongly encourage you to solve
the problem by hand. This will help you develop a better understanding
of how generating functions can be used.
</p>

<p>
For all exercises in this section, <q>generating function</q> should be
taken to mean <q>ordinary generating function.</q> Exponential generating
functions are only required in exercises specifically mentioning them.

</ol>
</li>
<li>Find the coefficient on <m>x^{10}</m> in each of the generating
  functions below.

   create a bunch of <m>n</m> balloons selected from white, gold, and blue
   balloons so that the bunch contains at least one white balloon, at
   least one gold balloon, and at most two blue balloons. How many
   ways are there to create a bunch of <m>10</m> balloons subject to these
   requirements?</li>
<li>A volunteer coordinator has <m>30</m> identical chocolate chip
   cookies to distribute to six volunteers. Use a generating function
   (and computer algebra system) to determine the number of ways she
   can distribute the cookies so that each volunteer receives at least
   two cookies and no more than seven cookies.</li>
<li>Consider the inequality
<me>
  x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4\leq n
</me>
where <m>x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,n\geq 0</m> are all
   integers. Suppose also that <m>x_2\geq 2</m>, <m>x_3</m> is a multiple of
   <m>4</m>, and <m>1\leq x_4\leq 3</m>. Let <m>c_n</m> be the number of solutions of
   the inequality subject to these restrictions. Find the generating
   function for the sequence <m>\{c_n\colon n\geq 0\}</m> and use it to
   find a closed formula for <m>c_n</m>.</li>
<li>Find the generating function for the number of ways to
   distribute blank scratch paper to Alice, Bob, Carlos, and Dave so
   that Alice gets at least two sheets, Bob gets at most three sheets,
   the number of sheets Carlos receives is a multiple of three, and
   Dave gets at least one sheet but no more than six sheets of scratch
   paper. Without finding the power series expansion for this
   generating function (or using a computer algebra system!),
   determine the coefficients on <m>x^2</m> and <m>x^3</m> in this generating
   function.</li>
<li>What is the generating function for the number of ways
   to select a group of <m>n</m> students from a class of <m>p</m> students?</li>
<li>Using generating functions, find a formula for the
   number of different types of fruit baskets containing of <m>n</m> pieces
   of fruit chosen from pomegranates, bananas, apples, oranges, pears,
   and figs that can be made subject to the following restrictions:
<ul>
<li>there are either <m>0</m> or <m>2</m> pomegranates,</li>
<li>there is at least <m>1</m> banana,</li>
<li>the number of figs is a multiple of <m>5</m>,</li>
<li>there are at most <m>4</m> pears, and</li>
<li>there are no restrictions on the number of apples or oranges.</li>
</ul>
How many ways are there to form such a fruit basket with <m>n=25</m> pieces of
  fruit?</li>
<li>Using generating functions, find the number of ways to make
  change for a <dollar /><m>100</m> bill using only dollar coins and <dollar /><m>1</m>, <dollar /><m>2</m>,
  and <dollar /><m>5</m> bills. (<em>Hint</em>: Find the partial fractions expansion
  for your generating function. Once you have it, you may find the
  following identity helpful
<me>
  \frac{p(x)}{1+x+x^2+\cdots + x^k} = \frac{p(x)(1-x)}{1-x^{k+1}},
</me>
where <m>p(x)</m> will be a polynomial in this instance.)</li>
<li>A businesswoman is traveling in Belgium and wants to
  buy chocolates for herself, her husband, and their two daughters. A
  store has dark chocolate truffles (\EURdig  10/box), milk
  chocolate truffles (\EURdig  8/box), nougat-filled
  chocolates (\EURdig  5/box), milk chocolate bars
  (\EURdig  7/bar), and 75<percent /> cacao chocolate bars
  (\EURdig  11/bar). Her purchase is to be subject to the
  following:
<ul>
<li>Only the daughters like dark chocolate truffles, and her
    purchase must ensure that each daughter gets an equal number of
    boxes of them (if they get any).</li>
<li>At least two boxes of milk chocolate truffles must be
    purchased.</li>
<li>If she buys any boxes of nougat-filled chocolates, then she
    buys exactly enough that each family member gets precisely one
    box of them.</li>
<li>At most three milk chocolate bars may be purchased.</li>
<li>There are no restrictions on the number of 75<percent /> cacao
    chocolate bars.</li>
</ul>
Let <m>s_n</m> be the number of ways the businesswoman can spend exactly
  \EURdig  <m>n</m> (<b>not</b> buy <m>n</m> items!) at this
  chocolate shop. Find the generating function for the sequence
  <m>\{s_n\colon n\geq 0\}</m>. In how many ways can she spend exactly
  \EURdig  100 at the chocolate shop? (A computer algebra
  system will be helpful for finding coefficients.)</li>
<li>Bags of candy are being prepared to distribute to the children
  at a school. The types of candy available are chocolate bites,
  peanut butter cups, peppermint candies, and fruit chews. Each bag
  must contain at least two chocolate bites, an even number of peanut
  butter cups, and at most six peppermint candies. The fruit chews are
  available in four different flavors&#8202;&#x2014;&#8202;lemon, orange, strawberry, and
  cherry. A bag of candy may contain at most two fruit chews, which
  may be of the same or different flavors. Beyond the number of pieces
  of each type of candy included, bags of candy are distinguished by
  using the flavors of the fruit chews included, not just the
  number. For example, a bag containing two orange fruit chews is
  different from a bag containing a cherry fruit chew and a strawberry
  fruit chew, even if the number of pieces of each other type of candy
  is the same.
<ol>
<li>Let <m>b_n</m> be the number of different bags of candy with <m>n</m>
    pieces of candy that can be formed subject to these restrictions.
    Find the generating function for the sequence <m>\{b_n\colon n\geq
    0\}</m>.</li>
<li>Suppose the school has <m>400</m> students and the teachers would
    like to ensure that each student gets a different bag of
    candy. However, they know there will be fights if the bags do not
    all contain the same number of pieces of candy. What is the
    smallest number of pieces of candy they can include in the bags
    that ensures each student gets a different bag of candy containing
    the same number of pieces of candy?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Make up a combinatorial problem (similar to those found in this
  chapter) that leads to the generating function
<me>
  \frac{(1+x^2+x^4)x^2}{(1-x)^3(1-x^3)(1-x^{10})}.
</me>

<li>Tollbooths in Illinois accept all U.S. coins, including
  pennies. Carlos has a very large supply of pennies, nickels,
  dimes, and quarters in his car as he drives on a tollway. He
  encounters a toll for <dollar /><m>0.95</m> and wonders how many different
  ways he could use his supply of coins to pay the toll without
  getting change back.
<ol>
<li>Use a generating function and computer algebra system to
    determine the number of ways Carlos could pay his <dollar /><m>0.95</m> toll by
    dropping the coins together into the toll bin. (Assume coins of
    the same denomination cannot be distinguished from each other.)</li>
<li>Suppose that instead of having a bin into which motorists drop
    the coins to pay their toll, the coins must be inserted one-by-one
    into a coin slot. In this scenario, Carlos wonders how many ways
    he could pay the <dollar /><m>0.95</m> toll when the order the coins are
    inserted matters. For instance, in the previous part, the use of
    three quarters and two dimes would be counted only one
    time. However, when the coins must be inserted individually into a
    slot, there are <m>10=C(5,2)</m> ways to insert this combination. Use
    an ordinary generating function and computer algebra system to
    determine the number of ways that Carlos could pay the <dollar /><m>0.95</m>
    toll when considering the order the coins are inserted.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>List the partitions of <m>9</m>. Write a D next to each partition
  into distinct parts and an O next to each partition into odd parts.</li>
<li>Use generating functions to find the number of ways to
  partition <m>10</m> into odd parts.</li>
<li>What is the smallest integer that can be partitioned in at least
  <m>1000</m> ways? How many ways can it be partitioned? How many of them
  are into distinct parts? (A computer algebra system will be helpful
  for this exercise.)</li>
<li>What is the generating function for the number of
  partitions of an integer into even parts?</li>
<li>Find the exponential generating function (in closed form, not as
  an infinite sum) for each infinite sequence <m>\{a_n\colon n\geq 0\}</m>
  whose general term is given below.
<ol>
<li><m>a_n = 5^n</m></li>
<li><m>a_n = (-1)^n2^n</m></li>
<li><m>a_n = 3^{n+2}</m></li>
<li><m>a_n = n!</m></li>
<li><m>a_n = n</m></li>
<li><m>a_n = 1/(n+1)</m></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>For each exponential generating function below, give a formula
  in closed form for the sequence <m>\{a_n\colon n\geq 0\}</m> it
  represents.
<ol>
<li><m>e^{7x}</m></li>
<li><m>x^2 e^{3x}</m></li>
<li><m>\displaystyle \frac{1}{1+x}</m></li>
<li><m>e^{x^4}</m></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Find the coefficient on <m>x^{10}/{10!}</m> in each of the
  exponential generating functions below.
<ol>
<li><m>e^{3x}</m></li>
<li><m>\displaystyle\frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{2}</m></li>
<li><m>\displaystyle\frac{e^x+e^{-x}}{2}</m></li>
<li><m>xe^{3x}-x^2</m></li>
<li><m>\displaystyle\frac{1}{1-2x}</m></li>
<li><m>e^{x^2}</m></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Find the exponential generating function for the number of
  strings of length <m>n</m> formed from the set <m>\{a,b,c,d\}</m> if there
  must be at least one <m>a</m> and the number of <m>c</m>'s must be even. Find
  a closed formula for the coefficients of this exponential generating
  function.</li>
<li>Find the exponential generating function for the number of
  strings of length <m>n</m> formed from the set <m>\{a,b,c,d\}</m> if there

  closed formula for the coefficients of this exponential generating
  function.</li>

  number of <m>d</m>'s is either <m>1</m> or <m>2</m>. Find a closed formula for the
  coefficients of this exponential generating function.</li>

<title>Formal Development of Number Systems</title>


<introduction>
<p>
Up to this point, we have been discussing number systems
in an entirely informal manner, assuming everyone knew
all that needed to be known. Now let's pause and put
things on a more firm foundation. So
for the time being, do a memory dump and forget everything you have ever
learned about numbers and arithmetic. The set
of natural numbers has just been delivered on our
door step in a big box with a warning label saying <q>Assembly
Required.</q> We open the box and find a single piece of paper
on which the following <q>instructions</q> are printed. These
defining properties of the natural numbers are known as the <em>Peano
Postulates</em>.
</p>

<ol>
<li class="custom-list-style-type" label="(i)." >There is a non-empty set of elements called 
<em>natural numbers</em>.  There is natural number
called <em>zero</em> which is denoted<nbsp /><m>0</m>.  The set of all natural
numbers is denoted <m>\mathbb{N}_0</m></li>
<li class="custom-list-style-type" label="(ii)." >There is a one-to-one function <m>s:\mathbb{N}_0
\injection \mathbb{N}_0</m>
called the <em>successor</em> function.  For each <m>n\in \mathbb{N}_0</m>,
<m>s(n)</m> is called the <em>successor</em> of <m>n</m>.</li>
<li class="custom-list-style-type" label="(iii)." >There is no natural number <m>n</m> for which <m>0=s(n)</m>.</li>
<li class="custom-list-style-type" label="(iv)." >Let <m>\mathbb{M}\subseteq \mathbb{N}_0</m>.  
Then <m>\mathbb{M} =\mathbb{N}_0</m> if and only if
<ol>
<li class="custom-list-style-type" label="(a)." ><m>0\in \mathbb{M}</m>; and</li>
<li class="custom-list-style-type" label="(b)." ><m>\forall k\in \mathbb{N}_0\quad(k\in \mathbb{M}) 
  \Longrightarrow(s(k)\in \mathbb{M})</m>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Property<nbsp />(iv) in the list of Peano Postulates is called
the <em>Principle of Mathematical Induction</em>, or
just the <em>Principle of Induction</em>.
As a first application of the Principle of Induction, we prove the following
basic property of the natural numbers.
</p>

<proposition>
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>n</m> be a natural number with <m>n\neq0</m>. Then there is a
natural number <m>m</m> so that <m>n=s(m)</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</proposition>

<proof>
<p>
Let <m>\mathbb{S}=\{n\in\mathbb{N}_0:\exists m\in\mathbb{N}_0,
n=s(m)\}</m>. Then set <m>\mathbb{M}=\{0\}\cup\mathbb{S}</m>.
We show that <m>\mathbb{M}=\mathbb{N}_0</m>. First, note that
<m>0\in\mathbb{M}</m>. Next, we will show that for all <m>k\in\mathbb{N}_0</m>,
if <m>k\in\mathbb{M}</m>, then <m>s(k)\in\mathbb{M}</m>. However, this is trivial
since for all <m>k\in\mathbb{N}_0</m>, we have
<m>s(k)\in\mathbb{S}\subseteq\mathbb{M}</m>.
We conclude that <m>\mathbb{M}=\mathbb{N}_0</m>.
</p>
</proof>
</introduction>


<subsection xml:id="s_background_add">
<title>Addition as a Binary Operation</title>
<p>
Recall that a <em>binary operator</em> <m>*</m> on set <m>X</m> is just
a function <m>*:X\times X\rightarrow X</m>. So the image of
the ordered pair <m>(x,y)</m> would normally be denoted <m>*((x,y))</m>.
However, this is usually abbreviated as <m>*(x,y)</m> or
even more compactly as <m>x*y</m>. With this convention,
we now define a binary operation <m>+</m>
on the the set <m>\mathbb{N}_0</m> of natural numbers.
This operation is defined by:
</p>

<p>
For every natural number <m>n\in\mathbb{N}_0</m>:
</p>

<ol>
<li class="custom-list-style-type" label="(i)." ><m>n+0=n</m>.</li>
<li class="custom-list-style-type" label="(ii)." >For all <m>k\in\mathbb{N}_0</m>, <m>n+s(k) = s(n+k)</m>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
We pause to make it clear why the preceding two statements
define <m>+</m>. Let <m>n</m> be
an arbitrary natural number. Then let <m>\mathbb{M}</m> denote the
set of all natural numbers <m>m</m> for which <m>n+m</m> is
defined. Note that <m>0\in \mathbb{M}</m> by part<nbsp />(i). Also note
that for all <m>k\in \mathbb{N}_0</m>, <m>s(k)\in \mathbb{M}</m> whenever
<m>k\in \mathbb{M}</m> by part<nbsp />(ii). This
shows that <m>\mathbb{M}=\mathbb{N}_0</m>. Since <m>n</m> was arbitrary, this allows us
to conclude that <m>n+m</m> is defined for all <m>n,m\in \mathbb{N}_0</m>.
</p>

<p>
We read <m>n+m</m> as <m>n</m> <em>plus</em> <m>m</m>. The operation <m>+</m>
is also called <em>addition</em>.
</p>

<p>
Among the natural numbers, the successor of zero plays a very
important role, so important that it deserves its own special
symbol. Here we follow tradition and call the natural number
<m>s(0)</m> <em>one</em> and denote it by<nbsp /><m>1</m>.
Note that for every natural number
<m>n</m>, we have <m>n+1=n+s(0)=s(n)</m>. In particular, <m>0+1=1</m>.
</p>

<p>
With this notation, the Principle of Induction can be
restated in the following form, which many of you may already have seen.
</p>

<p>
<b>The Principle of Induction.</b> 
Let <m>\mathbb{M}\subseteq \mathbb{N}_0</m>.
Then <m>\mathbb{M} =\mathbb{N}_0</m> if and only if
</p>

<ol>
<li class="custom-list-style-type" label="(a)." ><m>0\in \mathbb{M}</m>; and</li>
<li class="custom-list-style-type" label="(b)." ><m>\forall k\in \mathbb{N}_0\quad(k\in \mathbb{M}) 
  \Longrightarrow(k+1\in \mathbb{M})</m>.</li>
</ol>

<theorem>
<statement>
<p>
{ [Associative Property of Addition]}<br />
<m>m+(n+p) = (m+n)+p</m>, for all <m>m,n,p\in \mathbb{N}_0</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</theorem>

<proof>
<p>
Let <m>m,n\in \mathbb{N}_0</m>. Then let
<m>\mathbb{M}</m> denote the set of all natural numbers <m>p</m> for
which <m>m+(n+p)=(m+n)+p</m>. We show that <m>\mathbb{M}=\mathbb{N}_0</m>.
</p>

<p>
Note that
</p>
<me>
  m+(n+0) = m+n = (m+n)+0
</me>
<p>
which shows that <m>0\in \mathbb{M}</m>.
</p>

<p>
Now assume that <m>k\in \mathbb{M}</m>, i.e., <m>m+(n+k) = (m+n)+k</m>.
Then
</p>
<me>
  m+[n+(k+1)]=m+[(n+k)+1]=[m+(n+k)]+1= [(m+n)+k]+1=(m+n)+(k+1).
</me>
<p>
Notice here that the first, second, and fourth equalities follow from
the second part of the definition of addition while the third uses our
inductive assumption that <m>m+(n+k)=(m+n)+k)</m>. This shows that <m>k+1\in
\mathbb{M}</m>. Therefore, <m>\mathbb{M}= \mathbb{N}_0</m>. Since <m>m</m> and
<m>n</m> were arbitrary elements of <m>\mathbb{N}_0</m>, the theorem follows.
</p>
</proof>

<p>
In proofs to follow, we will trim out some of the wording
and leave only the essential mathematical steps intact.
In particular, we will (i)<nbsp />omit reference to the set <m>\mathbb{M}</m>,
and (ii)<nbsp />drop the phrase <q>For all <m>k\in\mathbb{N}_0</m></q>
For example, to define addition, we will just
write (i)<nbsp /><m>n+0=n</m>, and (ii)<nbsp /><m>n+(k+1) = (n+k)+1</m>.
</p>

<lemma>
<statement>
<p>
<m>m+(n+1) = (m+1)+n</m>, for all <m>m,n\in\mathbb{N}_0</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</lemma>

<proof>
<p>
Fix <m>m\in \mathbb{N}_0</m>. Then
</p>
<me>
  m+(0+1)=m+1= (m+0)+1.
</me>
<p>
Now assume that <m>m+(k+1)=(m+1)+k</m>.
Then
</p>
<me>
  m+[(k+1)+1]=[m+(k+1)]+1=[(m+1)+k]+1=(m+1)+(k+1).
</me>
</proof>

<p>
We next prove the commutative property, a task that takes
two steps. First, we prove the following special case.
</p>

<lemma>
<statement>
<p>
<m>n+0 = 0+n=n</m>, for all <m>n\in \mathbb{N}_0</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</lemma>

<proof>
<p>
The statement is trivially true when <m>n= 0</m>.
Now suppose that <m>k+0=0+k=k</m> for some <m>k\in \mathbb{N}_0</m>.
Then
</p>
<me>
  (k+1) +0 = k+1 = (0+k)+1= 0+(k+1).
</me>
</proof>

<theorem>
<statement>
<p>
{ [Commutative Law of Addition]}<br />
<m>m+n=n+m</m> for all <m>m,n\in \mathbb{N}_0</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</theorem>

<proof>
<p>
Let <m>m\in \mathbb{N}_0</m>. Then <m>m+0=0+m</m> from the preceding lemma.
Assume <m>m+k=k+m</m>. Then
</p>
<me>
  m+(k+1)=(m+k)+1=(k+m)+1= k+(m+1) = (k+1)+m.
</me>
</proof>

<lemma xml:id="lem_sum0">
<statement>
<p>
If <m>m,n\in\mathbb{N}_0</m> and <m>m+n=0</m>, then <m>m=n=0</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</lemma>

<proof>
<p>
Suppose that either of <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> is not zero. Since addition
is commutative, we may assume without loss of generality that
<m>n\neq0</m>. Then there exists a natural number
<m>p</m> so that <m>n=s(p)</m>. This implies that <m>m+n=m+s(p)=s(m+p)=0</m>,
which is impossible since <m>0</m> is not the successor of any
natural number.
</p>
</proof>

<theorem>
<statement>
<p>
{ [Cancellation Law of Addition]}<br />
If <m>m,n,p\in \mathbb{N}_0</m> and <m>m+p=n+p</m>, then <m>m=n</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</theorem>

<proof>
<p>
Let <m>m,n\in \mathbb{N}_0</m>. Suppose that <m>m+0=n+0</m>. Then <m>m=n</m>.
Now suppose that <m>m=n</m> whenever <m>m+k=n+k</m>.
If <m>m+(k+1)=n+(k+1)</m>, then
</p>
<me>
  s(m+k)=(m+k)+1=m+(k+1)=n+(k+1)=(n+k)+1=s(n+k).
</me>
<p>
Since <m>s</m> is an
injection, this implies <m>m+k=n+k</m>. Thus <m>m=n</m>.
</p>
</proof>

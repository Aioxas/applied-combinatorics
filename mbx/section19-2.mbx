<title>Intersections and Unions</title>


<introduction>
<p>
When <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are sets, the <em>intersection</em>
of <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>, denoted <m>X\cap Y</m>, is defined by
</p>
<me>
  X\cap Y = \{x: x\in X, x\in Y\}
</me>
<p>
Note that this notation uses the convention followed by
many programming languages. Namely, the <q>comma</q> in the
definition means that <em>both</em> requirements for
membership be satisfied. For example, if <m>X=\{b,c,e,g,m\}</m>
and <m>Y=\{a,c,d,h,m,n,p\}</m>, then <m>X\cap Y=\{c,m\}</m>.

<title>The Meaning of <m>2</m>-Letter Words</title>
<p>
In the not too distant past, there was considerable discussion
in the popular press on the meaning of the <m>2</m>-letter word <em>is</em>.
For mathematicians and computer scientists, it would have
been far more significant to have a discussion of the <m>2</m>-letter
word <em>or</em>. The problem is that the English language uses
<em>or</em> in two fundamentally different ways. Consider the
following sentences:
</p>

<ol>
<li>A nearby restaurant has a dinner special featuring two choices for
dessert: flan de casa <b>or</b> tirami-su.</li>
<li>A state university accepts all students who have graduated
from in-state high schools and have SAT scores above <m>1000</m> <b>or</b> 
have grade point averages above <m>3.0</m>.</li>
<li>A local newpaper offers 
customers the option of paying their for their newspaper bills on a monthly
<b>or</b> semi-annual basis.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In the first and third statement, it is clear that there are
two options but that <em>only</em> one of them is allowed. However,
in the second statement, the interpretation is that admission will
be granted to students who satisfy <em>at least one</em> of the
two requirements. These interpretations are called
respectively the <em>exclusive</em>
and <em>inclusive</em> versions of <b>or</b>. In this class, we
will assume that whenever the word <q>or</q> is used,
the inclusive interpretation is intended&#8202;&#x2014;&#8202;unless otherwise
stated.
</p>

<p>
For example, when <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are sets, the <em>union</em>
of <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m>, denoted <m>X\cup Y</m>, is defined by
</p>
<me>
  X\cup Y = \{x: x\in x \text{ or }  x\in Y\}.
</me>
<p>
membership be satisfied. For example, if <m>X=\{b,c,e,g,m\}</m>
and <m>Y=\{a,c,d,h,m,n,p\}</m>, then <m>X\cup Y=\{a,b,c,d,e,g,h,m,n,p\}</m>.
</p>

<p>
Note that <m>\cap</m> and <m>\cup</m> are <em>commutative</em> and
<em>associative</em> binary operations, as is the case with
addition and multiplication for the set <m>\posints</m> of positive
integers, i.e., if <m>X</m>, <m>Y</m> and <m>Z</m> are sets, then
</p>
<me>
  X\cap Y = Y\cap X \quad\text{ and } \quad X\cup Y = Y\cup X.
</me>
<p>
Also,
</p>
<me>
  X\cap(Y\cap Z)= (X\cap Y)\cap Z\quad\text{ and } \quad
X\cup(Y\cup Z)= (X\cup Y)\cup Z.
</me>
<p>
Also, note that each of <m>\cap</m> and <m>\cup</m> distributes
over the other, i.e.,
</p>
<me>
  X\cap(Y\cup Z)= (X\cap Y)\cup (X\cap Z)\quad\text{ and } \quad
X\cup(Y\cap Z)= (X\cup Y)\cap (X\cup Z)
</me>
<p>
On the other hand, in <m>\posints</m>, multiplication distributes
over addition but not vice-versa.

<title>The Empty Set: Much To Do About Nothing</title>
<p>
The <em>empty set</em>, denoted <m>\emptyset</m> is the set for
which <m>x\notin \emptyset</m> for every element <m>x</m>. Note that
<m>X\cap \emptyset =\emptyset</m> and <m>X\cup \emptyset=X</m>, for every
set <m>X</m>.
</p>

<p>
The empty set is unique in the sense that if <m>x\notin X</m> for every
element <m>x</m>, then <m>X=\emptyset</m>.

<title>The First So Many Positive Integers</title>
<p>
In our course, we will use the symbols <m>\posints</m>, <m>\ints</m>,
<m>\rats</m> and <m>\reals</m> to denote respectively the
set of positive integers, the set of all integers (positive, negative
and zero), the set of rational numbers (fractions) and the set of real
numbers (rationals and irrationals). On occasion, we will discuss
the set <m>\nonnegints</m> of <em>non-negative integers</em>.
When <m>n</m> is a positive integer, we will use the
abbreviation <m>[n]</m> for the set <m>\{1,2,\dots,n\}</m> of the
first <m>n</m> positive integers. For example, <m>[5]=\{1,2,3,4,5\}</m>.
For reasons that may not be clear at the moment but hopefully
will be transparent later in the semester, we use the
notation <m>\bfn</m> to denote the <m>n</m>-element set <m>\{0,1,2,\dots,n-1\}</m>.
Of course, <m>\bfn</m> is just the set of the first <m>n</m> non-negative
integers. For example, <m>\mathbf{5}=\{0,1,2,3,4\}</m>.

<title>Subsets, Proper Subsets and Equal Sets</title>
<p>
When <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are sets, we say <m>X</m> is a <em>subset</em> of <m>Y</m> and
write <m>X\subseteq Y</m> when <m>x\in Y</m> for every <m>x\in X</m>. When <m>X</m> is a
subset of <m>Y</m> and there exists at least one element <m>y\in Y</m> with
<m>y\notin X</m>, we say <m>X</m> is a proper subset of <m>Y</m> and write
<m>X\subsetneq Y</m>. For example, the <m>P</m> of primes is a proper subset of
the set <m>\posints</m> of positive integers.
</p>

<p>
Surprisingly often, we will encounter a situation where
sets <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> have different rules for membership
yet both are in fact the same set. For example, let
<m>X=\{0,2\}</m> and <m>Y=\{z\in\ints: z+z=z\times z\}</m>. Then <m>X=Y</m>.
For this reason, it is useful to have a test when sets are
equal. If <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are sets, then
</p>
<me>
  X = Y \quad\text{ if and only if } \quad X\subseteq Y \text{ and }  Y\subseteq X.

A binary relation <m>R</m> is:
</p>

<ol>
<li class="custom-list-style-type" label="(iv)." ><em>symmetric</em> if <m>(x,y)\in R</m> implies <m>(y,x)\in R</m> for
all <m>x,y\in X</m>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
A binary relation <m>R</m> on a set <m>X</m> is called an
<em>equivalence relation</em> when it is reflexive, symmetric
and transitive. Typically, symbols like, <m>=</m>, <m>\cong</m>,
<m>\equiv</m> and <m>\sim</m> are used to
denote equivalence relations. An equivalence relation, say
<m>\cong</m>, defines
a partition on the set <m>X</m> by setting
</p>
<me>
  \langle x\rangle =\{y\in X: x\cong y\}
</me>
<p>
Note that if <m>x,y\in X</m> and <m>\langle x\rangle\cap\langle y\rangle
\neq\emptyset</m>, then <m>\langle x\rangle=\langle y\rangle</m>.
The sets in this partition are called <em>equivalence classes</em>.
</p>

<p>
When using the ordered pair notation for binary relations,
to indicate that a pair <m>(x,y)</m> is not in the relation,
we simply write <m>(x,y)\notin R</m>. When using the alternate
notation, this is usually denoted by using the negation
symbol from logic and writing <m>\lnot (xRy)</m>. Many of the
special symbols used to denote equivalence relations
come with negative versions: <m>x\neq y</m>, <m>x\ncong y</m>,
<m>x\nsim y</m>, etc.

In <xref ref="ex_radiostations">Example</xref>, we
discussed the problem of assigning frequencies to radio stations in
the situation where stations within <m>200</m> miles of each other must
broadcast on distinct frequencies. Clearly we would like to use the
smallest number of frequencies possible for a given layouts of
transmitters, but how can we determine what that number is?

Suppose three new homes are being built and each of them must be
provided with utility connections. The utilites in question are water,
electricity, and natural gas. Each provider needs a direct line from
their terminal to each house (the line can zig-zag all it wants, but
it must go from the terminal to the house without passing through
another provider's terminal or another house en route), and the three
providers all wish to bury their lines exactly four feet below
ground. Can they do this successfully without the lines crossing?

These are just two of many, many examples where the discrete structure
known as a <em>graph</em> can serve as an enlightening mathematical
model. Graphs are perhaps the most basic and widely studied
combinatorial structure, and they are prominently featured in this
text. Many of the concepts we will study, while presented in a more
abstract mathematical sense, have their origins in applications of
graphs as models for real-world problems.

<title>Exercises</title><ol><li>We say that a relation <m>R</m> on a set <m>X</m> is <em>symmetric</em> if
  <m>(x,y)\in R</m> implies <m>(y,x)\in R</m> for all <m>x,y\in X</m>. If
  <m>X=\{a,b,c,d,e,f\}</m>, how many symmetric relations are there on <m>X</m>?
  How many of these are reflexive?</li>
<li>A relation <m>R</m> on a set <m>X</m> is an <em>equivalence relation</em>
  if <m>R</m> is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Fix an integer
  <m>m\geq 2</m>. Show that the relation defined on the set
  <m>\ints</m> of integers by <m>aRb</m> (<m>a,b\in\ints</m>) if and only if <m>a\equiv
  b\pmod{m}</m> is an equivalence relation. (Recall that <m>a\equiv
  b\pmod{m}</m> means that when dividing <m>a</m> by <m>m</m> and <m>b</m> by <m>m</m> you
  get the same remainder.)</li>
<li>Is the binary relation 
<me>
P=\{(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4),(1,3),(2,4),(2,5),(4,5),(3,5),(1,5)\}
</me>
  a partial
  order on the set <m>X=\{1,2,3,4,5\}</m>? If so, discuss what properties
  you verified and how. If not, list the ordered pairs that must be
  added to <m>P</m> to make it a partial order or say why it cannot be made
  a partial order by adding ordered pairs.</li>
<li xml:id="exer_posets_division" >Draw the diagram of the poset <m>\bfP=(X,P)</m> where
  <m>X=\{1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30\}</m> and <m>x\leq y</m> in <m>P</m> if and only if
  <m>x|y</m>. (Recall that <m>x|y</m> means that <m>x</m> evenly divides <m>y</m> without
  remainder. Equivalently <m>x|y</m>, if and only if <m>y\equiv
  0\pmod{x}</m>.) </li>
<li>Draw the diagram of the poset <m>\PXP</m> where
 
<md>X=\{\{1,3,4,5,6\},\{1,2,4,5,6\},\{1,2,3,6\},\{1,2,3\},\{1,5,6\},\\\{1,3,6\},\{1,2\},\{1,6\},\{3,5\},\{1\},\{3\},\{4\}\}
</md>
 
 and <m>P</m> is the partial order on <m>X</m> given by the <q>is a subset of</q>
 relationship.</li>
<li>A <em>linear extension</em> of a poset <m>\bfP=(X,P)</m> is a total
  order <m>L</m> on <m>X</m> such that if <m>x\leq y</m> in <m>P</m>, then <m>x\leq y</m> in <m>L</m>. Give 
  linear extension of the three posets shown in <xref ref="fig_constructposets" autoname="yes" />.
  If you feel very ambitious, try to count the number of linear extensions of
  the poset on the left side of the figure.  Don't list them.  Just provide an
  integer as your answer.</li>
<li>Alice and Bob are considering posets <m>\bfP</m> and <m>\bfQ</m>. They
  soon realize that <m>\bfQ</m> is isomorphic to <m>\bfP^d</m>. After <m>10</m>
  minutes of work, they figure out that <m>\bfP</m> has height <m>5</m> and
  width <m>3</m>. Bob doesn't want do find the height and width of <m>\bfQ</m>,
  since he figures it will take (at least) another <m>10</m> minutes to
  answer these questions for <m>\bfQ</m>. Alice says Bob is crazy and that
  she already knows the height and width of <m>\bfQ</m>. Who's right and
  why?</li>
<li>For this exercise, consider the poset <m>\bfP</m> in <xref ref="fig_17ptposet" autoname="yes" />.
  <ol><li>List the maximal elements of <m>\bfP</m>.</li>
<li>List the minimal elements of <m>\bfP</m>.</li>
<li>Find a maximal chain with two points in <m>\bfP</m>.</li>
<li>Find a chain in <m>\bfP</m> with three points that is <em>not</em>
    maximal. Say why your chain is not maximal.</li>
<li>Find a maximal antichain with four points in <m>\bfP</m>.</li>
 </ol> </li>
<li>Find the height <m>h</m> of the poset <m>\PXP</m> shown below as well as a
  maximum chain and a partition of <m>X</m> into <m>h</m> antichains using the
  algorithm from this chapter.

<li>For each of the two distinct (up to isomorphism) posets in 
  <xref ref="fig_constructposets" autoname="yes" />, find the width <m>w</m>, an
  antichain of size <m>w</m>, and a partition of the ground set into <m>w</m>
  chains.</li>
<li>A restaurant chef has designed a new set of dishes for his
  menu. His set of dishes contains <m>10</m> main courses, and he will
  select a subset of them to place on the menu each night. To ensure
  variety of main courses for his patrons, he wants to guarantee that
  a night's menu is neither completely contained in nor completely
  contains another night's menu. What is the largest number of menus
  he can plan using his <m>10</m> main courses subject to this requirement?</li>

<li>Complete the proof of <xref ref="thm_intord-minrep">Theorem</xref>.  <em>Hint.</em>
  The key idea is to show that if <m>d</m> is the least positive integer for
  which an interval order <m>\bfP</m> has a representation using end points from
  <m>\{1,2,\dots,n\}</m>, then every integer <m>i</m> from this set must be both a left
  end point and a right end point of an interval.</li>
<li>Show that every poset is isomorphic to a poset of each of the four types
  illustrated in <xref ref="exa_construct">Example</xref>.  Hint: for each element <m>x</m>, choose
  some unique identifying key which is an element/prime/coordinate/observer.  Then associate
  with <m>x</m> a structure that identifies the keys of elements from <m>D[x]</m>.</li>
<li>The <em>dimension</em> of a poset <m>\PXP</m>, denoted <m>\dim(\bfP)</m>, is the least <m>t</m> for 
  which <m>P</m> is the intersection of <m>t</m> linear orders on <m>X</m>.
  <ol><li>Show that the dimension of a poset <m>\bfP</m> is the same as the dimension of its dual.</li>
<li>Show that <m>\bfP</m> is a subposet of <m>\bfQ</m>, then <m>\dim(\bfP)\le \dim(\bfQ)</m>.</li>
<li>Show that the removal of a point can reduce the dimension by at most<nbsp /><m>1</m>.</li>
<li>Find the dimension of the posets in <xref ref="fig_constructposets" autoname="yes" />.</li>
<li>Use Dilworth's theorem to show that the dimension of a poset is at most its width.</li>
<li>Use the example on the left side of <xref ref="fig_FirstFit" autoname="yes" /> to show that
   for every <m>n\ge2</m>, there exists a poset <m>\bfP_n</m> on <m>2n</m> points having width and dimension
   equal to <m>n</m>.</li>

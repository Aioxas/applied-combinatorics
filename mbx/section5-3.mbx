<title>The Meaning of Statements</title>
<p>
Have you ever taken standardized tests where they give you the first
few terms of a sequence and then ask you for the next one? Here are
some sample questions. In each case, see if you can determine a
reasonable answer for the next term.
</p>
  <ol><li><m>2,5,8,11,14,17,20,23,26,\dots</m></li>
<li><m>1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,\dots</m></li>
<li><m>1,2,5,14,42,132,429,1430,4862,\dots</m></li>
<li><m>2,6,12,20,30,42,56,72,90,110,\dots</m></li>
<li><m>2,3,6,11,18,27,38,51,\dots</m></li>
 </ol>   
<p>
Pretty easy stuff! OK, now try the following somewhat more
challenging sequence. Here, we'll give you a lot more terms and
challenge you to find the next one.
</p>
  
<me>

1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5,2,3,4,5,6,2,3,4,5,6,1,2,3,4,5,2,3,4,5,6,\dots

</me>
 
<p>
Trust us when we say that we really have in mind something very
concrete, and once it's explained, you'll agree that it's <q>obvious.</q>
But for now, it's far from it.
</p>
  
<p>
Here's another danger lurking around the corner when we encounter
formulas like
</p>
  
<me>

1+2+3+\dots+n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}

</me>
 
<p>
What do the dots in this statement mean? In fact, let's consider a
much simpler question. What is meant by the following
expression:
</p>
  
<me>
1+2+3+\dots+6
</me>
  
<p>
Are we talking about the sum of the first six
positive integers, or are we talking about the sum of the first<nbsp /><m>19</m>
terms from the more complicated challenge sequence given above?
You are supposed to answer that you don't know, and that's the
correct answer.
</p>
  
<p>
The point here is that without a clarifying comment or two, the
notation <m>1+2+3+\dots+6</m> isn't precisely defined.
Let's see how to make things right.
</p>
  
<p>
First, let <m>f:\posints\longrightarrow\posints</m> be
a function. Set
</p>
  
<me>

\sum_{i=1}^1 f(i) = f(1)

</me>
 
<p>
and if <m>n>1</m>, define
</p>
  
<me>

\sum_{i=1}^n f(i) = f(n)+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}f(i)

</me>
 
<p>
To see that these two statements imply that the expression
<m>\sum_{i=1}^nf(i)</m> is defined for all positive integers, apply the
Well Ordered Property to the set of all positive integers for which
the expression is not defined and use the recursive definition to
define it for the least element.
</p>
  
<p>
So if we want to talk about the sum of the first six positive
integers, then we should write:
</p>
  
<me>

\sum_{i=1}^6 i

</me>
 
<p>
Now it is clear that we are talking about a computation that
yields<nbsp /><m>21</m> as an answer.
</p>
  
<p>
A second example:
previously, we defined <m>n!</m> by
writing
</p>
  
<me>

n! = n\times (n-1)\times (n-2)\times\dots\times3\times2\times 1

</me>
 
<p>
By this point, you should realize that there's a problem here.
Multiplication, like addition, is a binary operation. And what do
those dots mean? Here's a way to do the job more precisely. Define
<m>n!</m> to be <m>1</m> if <m>n=1</m>. And when <m>n>1</m>, set <m>n! = n(n-1)!</m>.
</p>
  
<p>
Definitions like these are called <em>recursive</em>
definitions. They can be made with different
starting points. For example, we could have set
<m>n!=1</m> when <m>n=0</m>, and when <m>n>0</m>, set <m>n!=n(n-1)!</m>.
</p>
  
<p>
Here's a code snippet using the C-programming language:
</p>
  
<p>
\begin{tt}
</p>
  
<p>
int sumrecursive(int n) \{<br />
\mbox{} if (n == 1) return 2;<br />
\mbox{} else return sumrecursive(n-1)+(n*n -2*n+3);<br />
\}<br />
\end{tt}
</p>
  
<p>
What is the value of <c>sumrecursive(4)</c>? Does it make
sense to you to say that <c>sumrecursive(n)</c> is defined
for all positive integers <m>n</m>? Did you recognize that this
program provides a precise meaning to the expression:
</p>
  
<me>

2+3+6+11+18+27+38+51+\dots +(n^2-2n+3)

</me>

<title>Mathematical Induction</title>
<p>
Now we move on to induction, the powerful twin of recursion.
</p>

<p>
Let <m>n</m> be a positive integer. Consider the following mathematical
statements, each of which involve <m>n</m>:
</p>

<ol>
<li><m>2n+7 = 13</m>.</li>
<li><m>3n-5=9</m>.</li>
<li><m>n^2-5n+9=3</m>.</li>
<li><m>8n-3 \lt  48</m>.</li>
<li><m>8n-3 > 0</m>.</li>
<li><m>(n+3)(n+2) =n^2+5n+6</m>.</li>
<li><m>n^2 -6n + 13 \ge 0</m>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Such statements are called <em>open</em> statements. Open statements
can be considered as <em>equations</em>, i.e., statements that are
valid for certain values of <m>n</m>. Statement<nbsp />1 is valid only when
<m>n=3</m>. Statement<nbsp />2 is never valid, i.e., it has no solutions among
the positive integers. Statement<nbsp />3 has exactly two solutions, and
Statement<nbsp />4 has six solutions. On the other hand, Statements<nbsp />5, 6
and<nbsp />7 are valid for all positive integers.
</p>

<p>
At this point, you are probably scratching your head, thinking that
this discussion is trivial. But let's consider some statements that
are a bit more complex.
</p>

<ol>
<li>The sum of the first <m>n</m> positive integers is <m>n(n+1)/2</m>.</li>
<li>The sum of the first <m>n</m> odd positive integers is <m>n^2</m>.</li>
<li><m>n^n \ge  n! + 4,000,000,000n2^n</m>  when <m>n\ge 14</m>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
How can we establish the validity of such statements, provided of
course that they are actually true? The starting point for providing
an answer is the following property:
</p>

<p>
<b>Principle of Mathematical Induction</b> Let <m>S_n</m> be an open
statement involving a positive integer <m>n</m>. If <m>S_1</m> is true, and if
for each positive integer <m>k</m>, assuming that the statement <m>S_k</m> is
true implies that the statement <m>S_{k+1}</m> is true, then <m>S_n</m> is true
for every positive integer<nbsp /><m>n</m>.
</p>

<p>
With a little thought, you should see that the Principle of
Mathematical Induction is logically equivalent to the Well Ordered
Property of Positive Integers. If you haven't already done so, now
might be a good time to look over <xref ref="app_background" autoname="yes" /> on background
material.

<title>Finite Sets</title>
<p>
A set <m>X</m> is said to be <em>finite</em> when either (1) <m>X=\emptyset</m>; or
(2) there exists positive integer <m>n</m> and a bijection <m>f:[n]\bijection X</m>.
When <m>X</m> is not finite, it is called <em>infinite</em>. For example,
<m>\{a,\emptyset,(3,2),\posints\}</m> is a finite set as is
<m>\posints\times\emptyset</m>. On the other hand, <m>\posints\times
\{\emptyset\}</m> is infinite. Of course, <m>[n]</m> and <m>\bfn</m> are
finite sets for every <m>n\in\posints</m>.
</p>

<proposition>
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>X</m> be a non-empty finite set. Then there is a unique
positive integer <m>n</m> for which there is a bijection <m>f:[n]\bijection X</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</proposition>

<p>
In some cases, it may take some effort to determine whether a set
is finite or infinite. Here is a truly
classic result.
</p>

<proposition>
<statement>
<p>
The set <m>P</m> of primes is infinite.
</p>
</statement>
</proposition>

<proof>
<p>
Suppose that the set <m>P</m> of primes is finite. It is non-empty
since <m>2\in P</m>. Let <m>n</m> be the unique positive integer for
which there exists a bijection <m>f:[n]\rightarrow P</m>. Then let
</p>
<me>
  p=1+f(1)\times f(2)\times f(3)\times \dots\times f(n)
</me>
<p>
Then <m>p</m> is prime (<em>Why</em>?) yet larger than any element of <m>P</m>.
The contradiction completes the proof.
</p>
</proof>

<p>
Here's a famous example of a set where no one knows if
the set is finite or not.
</p>
<conjecture>
<p>
It is conjectured that the following
set is infinite:
</p>
<me>
  T=\{n\in\posints:n \text{ and }  n+2 \text{ are both
primes } \}.
</me>
</conjecture>
<p>
This conjecture is known as the <em>Twin Primes Conjecture</em>.
Guaranteed <m>\text{A} ++</m> for any student who can settle it!

<proposition xml:id="exe_sb">
<statement>
<p>
Let <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> be finite sets. If there exists an injection
<m>f:X\injection Y</m> and an injection <m>g:Y \injection X</m>, then
there exists a bijection <m>h:X \bijection Y</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</proposition>

<p>
When <m>X</m> is a finite non-empty set, the <em>cardinality</em> of <m>X</m>,
denoted <m>|X|</m> is the unique positive integer <m>n</m> for which
there is a bijection <m>f:[n]\bijection X</m>. Intuitively,
<m>|X|</m> is the number of elements in <m>X</m>. For example,
</p>
<me>
  |\{(6,2), (8,(4,\emptyset)), \{3,\{5\}\}\}|=3.
</me>
<p>
By convention,
the cardinality of the empty set is taken to be zero, and we write
<m>|\emptyset|=0</m>.
</p>

<proposition xml:id="prop_xy">
<statement>
<p>
If <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are finite non-empty sets, then
<m>|X\times Y| =|X|\times |Y|</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</proposition>

<remark>
<p>
The statement in the last exercise is an example of <q>operator
overloading</q>, a technique featured in several programming
languages. Specifically, the times sign <m>\times</m> is used
twice but has different meanings. As part of <m>X\times Y</m>, it
denotes the cartesian product, while as part of <m>|X|\times |Y|</m>,
it means ordinary multiplication of positive integers. Programming
languages can keep track of the data types of variables and
apply the correct interpretation of an operator like <m>\times</m>
depending on the variables to which it is applied.
</p>
</remark>
<p>
We also have the following general form of <xref ref="prop_xy">Proposition</xref>:
</p>
<me>
  |X_1\times X_2\times\dots\times X_n|=
|X_1|\times |X_2|\times\dots\times |X_n|
</me>

<title>Recurrence Equations</title><introduction>
<p>
We have already seen many examples of recurrence in the definitions of
combinatorial functions and expressions. The development of number
systems in <xref ref="app_background" autoname="yes" /> lays the groundwork for recurrence in
mathematics. Other examples we have seen include the Collatz sequence
of <xref ref="ex_collatz">Example</xref> and the binomial
coefficients. In <xref ref="ch_induction" autoname="yes" />, we also saw how recurrences
could arise when enumerating strings with certain restrictions, but we
didn't discuss how we might get from a recursive definition of a
function to an explicit definition depending only on <m>n</m>, rather than
earlier values of the function. In this chapter, we present a more
systematic treatment of recurrence with the end goal of finding closed
form expressions for functions defined recursively&#8202;&#x2014;&#8202;whenever
possible. We will focus on the case of linear recurrence
equations. At the end of the chapter, we will also revisit some of
what we learned in <xref ref="ch_genfunction" autoname="yes" /> to see how generating
functions can also be used to solve recurrences.

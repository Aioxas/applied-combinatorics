<title>P&#xf3;lya's Enumeration Theorem</title>


<introduction>
<p>
In this chapter, we introduce a powerful enumeration technique
generally referred to as P&#xf3;lya's enumeration theorem<fn>Like
  so many results of mathematics, the crux of the result was
  originally discovered by someone other than the mathematician whose
  name is associated with it. J.H.<nbsp />Redfield published this result in
  1927, 10 years prior to P&#xf3;lya's work. It would take until 1960 for
  Redfield's work to be discovered, by which time P&#xf3;lya's name was
  firmly attached to the technique.</fn>. P&#xf3;lya's approach to counting
allows us to use symmetries (such as those of geometric objects like
polygons) to form generating functions. These generating functions can
then be used to answer combinatorial questions such as
</p>

<ol>
<li>How many different necklaces of six beads can be formed using
  red, blue and green beads? What about <m>500</m>-bead necklaces?</li>
<li>How many musical scales consisting of <m>6</m> notes are there?</li>
<li>How many isomers of the compound xylenol,
  <m>\text{C} _6\text{H} _3(\text{CH} _3)_2(\text{OH} )</m>, are there? What
  about <m>\text{C} _n \text{H} _{2n+2}</m>? (In chemistry, <em>isomers</em>
  are chemical compounds with the same number of molecules of each
  element but with different arrangements of those molecules.)</li>
<li>How many nonisomorphic graphs are there on four vertices? How
  many of them have three edges? What about on <m>1000</m> vertices with
  <m>257,000</m> edges? How many <m>r</m>-regular graphs are there on <m>40</m>
  vertices? (A graph is <m>r</m><em>-regular</em> if every vertex has degree
  <m>r</m>.)</li>
</ol>

<p>
To use P&#xf3;lya's techniques, we will require the idea of a permutation
group. However, our treatment will be self-contained and driven by
examples. We begin with a simplified version of the first question above.

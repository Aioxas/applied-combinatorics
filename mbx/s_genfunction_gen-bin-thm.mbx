<title>Newton's Binomial Theorem</title>
<p>
In <xref ref="ch_strings" autoname="yes" />, we discussed the binomial theorem and saw
that the following formula holds for all integers <m>p\ge1</m>:
</p>
<me>
  (1+x)^p =\sum_{n=0}^{p}\binom{p}{n} x^n.
</me>
<p>
You should quickly realize that this formula implies that the
generating function for the number of <m>n</m>-element subsets of a
<m>p</m>-element set is <m>(1+x)^p</m>. The topic of generating functions is
what leads us to consider what happens if we encounter <m>(1+x)^p</m> as a
generating function with <m>p</m> not a positive integer. It turns out
that, by suitably extending the definition of the binomial
coefficients to real numbers, we can also extend the binomial theorem
in a manner originally discovered by Sir Isaac Newton.
</p>

<p>
We've seen several expressions that can be used to calculate the
binomial coefficients, but in order to extend <m>C(p,k)</m> to real values
of <m>p</m>, we will utilize the form
</p>
<me>
  \binom{p}{k}=\frac{P(p,k)}{k!},
</me>
<p>
recalling that we've defined <m>P(p,k)</m> recursively as <m>P(p,0)=1</m> for
all integers <m>p\geq 0</m> and <m>P(p,k)=p P(p-1,k-1)</m> when <m>p\geq k > 0</m>
(<m>k</m> an integer). Notice here, however, that the expression for
<m>P(p,k)</m> makes sense for any real number <m>p</m>, so long as <m>k</m> is
a non-negative integer. We make this definition formal.
</p>
<definition>
<statement>
<p>
For all real numbers <m>p</m> and nonnegative integers <m>k</m>, the number
<m>P(p,k)</m> is defined by
</p>

<ol>
<li><m>P(p,0)=1</m> for all real numbers <m>p</m> and</li>
<li><m>P(p,k) = p P(p-1,k-1)</m> for all real numbers <m>p</m> and integers <m>k>0</m>.</li>
</ol>
</statement>
</definition>
<p>
(Notice that this definition does not require <m>p\geq k</m> as we did with
integers.)
</p>

<p>
We are now prepared to extend the definition of binomial coefficient
so that <m>C(p,k)</m> is defined for all real <m>p</m> and nonnegative integer
values of <m>k</m>. We do this as follows.
</p>
<definition>
<statement>
<p>
For all real numbers <m>p</m> and nonnegative integers <m>k</m>,
</p>
<me>
  \binom{p}{k}=\frac{P(p,k)}{k!}.
</me>
</statement>
</definition>
<p>
Note that <m>P(p,k)=C(p,k)= 0</m> when <m>p</m> and <m>k</m> are integers with
<m>0\le p\lt k</m>. On the other hand, we have some interesting new concepts
such as <m>P(-5,4)=(-5)(-6)(-7)(-8)</m> and
</p>
<me>
  \binom{-7/2}{5}=\frac{(-7/2)(-9/2)(-11/2)(-13/2)(-15/2)}{5!}.
</me>
<p>
With this more general definition of binomial coefficients in hand,
we're ready to state Newton's Binomial Theorem for all non-zero real
numbers. The proof of this theorem can be found in most advanced
calculus books.
</p>

<theorem xml:id="thm_newton-binomial">
<statement>
<p>
For all real <m>p</m> with <m>p\neq0</m>,
</p>
<me>
  (1+x)^p=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\binom{p}{n}x^n.
</me>
</statement>
</theorem>

<p>
Note that the general form reduces to the original version
of the binomial theorem when <m>p</m> is a positive integer.

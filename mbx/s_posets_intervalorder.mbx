    <title>Interval Orders</title>
    <p>When we discussed <xref ref="thm_dilworth" autoname="title" />, we commented that the algorithmic aspects would be deferred until later in the text. But there is one important class of orders for which the full solution is easy to obtain.
    </p>

    <p>A poset <m>\PXP</m> is called an <term>interval order</term><index><main>interval order</main></index> if there exists a function <m>I</m> assigning to each element <m>x\in X</m> a closed interval <m>I(x)=[a_x,b_x]</m> of the real line <m>\reals</m> so that for all <m>x</m>, <m>y\in X</m>, <m>x\lt y</m> in <m>P</m> if and only if <m>b_x\lt a_y</m> in <m>\reals</m>. We call <m>I</m> an <term>interval representation</term><index><main>interval representation</main></index> of <m>\bfP</m>, or just a <term>representation</term> for short. For brevity, whenever we say that <m>I</m> is a representation of an interval order <m>\PXP</m>, we will use the alternate notation <m>[a_x,b_x]</m> for the closed interval <m>I(x)</m>. Also, we let <m>|I(x)|</m> denote the <term>length</term> of the interval, i.e., <m>|I(x)|=b_x-a_x</m>. Returning to the poset <m>\bfP_3</m>, the representation shown in <xref ref="fig_6ptintorder" autoname="yes" /> shows that it is an interval order.

    <p>Note that end points of intervals used in a representation need not be distinct. In fact, distinct points <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> from <m>X</m> may satisfy <m>I(x)=I(y)</m>. We even allow degenerate intervals, i.e., those of the form <m>[a,a]</m>. On the other hand, a representation is said to be <term>distinguishing</term><index><main>interval representation</main><sub>distinguishing</sub></index> if all intervals are non-degenerate and all end points are distinct. It is relatively easy to see that every interval order has a distinguishing representation.

    <theorem xml:id="thm_fishburn">
        <title>Fishburn's Theorem</title>
        <statement>
            <p>Let <m>\PXP</m> be a poset. Then <m>\bfP</m> is an interval order if and only if it excludes <m>\bftwo+\bftwo</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
            <p>We show only that an interval order cannot contain a subposet isomorphic to <m>\bftwo+\bftwo</m>, deferring the proof in the other direction to the next section. Now suppose that <m>\PXP</m> is a poset, <m>\{x,y,z,w\}\subseteq X</m> and the subposet determined by these four points is isomorphic to <m>\bftwo+\bftwo</m>.  We show that <m>\bfP</m> is not an interval order. Suppose to the contrary that <m>I</m> is an interval representation of <m>\bfP</m>. Without loss of generality, we may assume that <m>x\lt y</m> and <m>z\lt w</m> in <m>P</m>. Thus <m>x\Vert w</m> and <m>z\Vert y</m> in <m>P</m>. Then <m>b_x\lt a_y</m> and <m>b_z \lt a_w</m> in <m>\reals</m> so that <m>a_w \le b_x \lt a_y \le b_z</m>, which is a contradiction.
            </p>
        </proof>

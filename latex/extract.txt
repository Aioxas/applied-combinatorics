\section{The Lovasz Local Lemma}

Even though humans seem to have great difficulty in 
providing expicit constructions for expontially large graphs 
which do not have complete subgraphs or independent sets 
of size~$n$, such graphs exist with great abundance.  Just 
take one at random and you are almost certain to get one.  And as a general
rule, probabilistic techniques often provide a method for
finding something that readily exists, but is hard to find.

Similarly, in the probabilistic proof that there exist
graphs with large girth and large chromatic number, we actually
showed that almost all graphs have modest sized independence
number and relatively few small cycles, provided that the
edge probability is chosen appropriately. The small cycles can
be destroyed without significantly changing the size of the
graph.

By way of contrast, probabilistic techniques can, in certain
circumstances, be used to find something which is exceedingly
rare.  We next present an elegant but elementary result, known
as the Lov\'asz Local Lemma, which has
proved to be very, very powerful.  The treatment is simplified
by the following natural notation.   When $E$ is an event
in a probability space, we let $\overline{E}$ denote the complement
of $E$.  Also, when $\cgF=\{E_1,E_2,\dots,E_k\}$ we
let
\[
\prod_{E\in\cgF}E=\prod_{i=1}^k E_i=E_1E_2E_3\dots E_k
\]
denote the event $E_1\cap E_2\cap\dots\cap E_k$, i.e.,
concatenation is short hand for intersection.  These notations
can be mixed, so $E_1\overline{E_2}\overline{E_3}$ represents
$E_1\cap \overline{E_2}\cap\overline{E_3}$.   Now let $\cgF$
be a finite family of events, let $E\in\cgF$ and let $\cgN$
be a subfamily of $\cgF-\{E\}$.  In the statement of the lemma 
below, we will say that $E$ is independent of any event not in 
$\cgN$ when
\[
P(E|\prod_{F\in\cgG}\overline{F}=P(E)
\]
provided $\cgG\cap\cgN=\emptyset$.

We first state and prove the lemma in \textit{asymmetric} form.
Later, we will give a simpler version which is called the
\textit{symmetric} version.

\begin{lemma}[Lov\'asz Local Lemma]\label{lem:LLL}
Let $\cgF$ be a finite family of events in a probability space 
and for each event $E\in\cgF$, let $\cgN(E)$ denote a
subfamily of events from $\cgF-\{E\}$ so that $E$ is independent of 
any event not in $\cgN(E)$.  Suppose that
for each event $E\in\cgF$, there is a real number $x(E)$ with
$0<x(E)<1$ such that
\[
P(E)\le x(E)\prod_{F\in\cgN(E)}(1-x(F)).
\]
Then for every non-empty subfamily $\cgG\subseteq\cgF$,
\[
P(\prod_{E\in\cgG}\overline{E})\ge\prod_{E\in\cgG}(1-x(E)).
\]
In particular, the probability that all events in $\cgF$ 
fail is positive.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We proceed by induction on $\cgG$. If $|\cgG|=1$ and $\cgG=\{E\}$,
we are simply asserting that $P(\overline{E})\ge 1-x(E)$, which is true
since $P(E)\le x(E)$.  Now suppose that $|\cgG|=k\ge2$ and that the lemma
holds whenever $1\le |\cgG|<k$.  Let $\cgG =\{E_1,E_2,\dots,E_k\}$.
Then
\[
P(\prod_{i\ge1}^k \overline{E_i})=P(\overline{E_1}|\prod_{i=2}^k\overline{E_i})
  P(\overline{E_2}|\prod_{i=3}^k\overline{E_i})P(E_3|\prod_{i=4}^k\overline{E_i})\dots
\]
Now each term in the product on the right has the following
form:
\[
P(\overline{E}|\prod_{F\in\cgF_E}\overline{F})
\]
where $|\cgF_E|<k$.

So, we done if we can show that
\[
P(\overline{E}|\prod_{F\in\cgF_E}\overline{F})\ge 1- x(E)
\]

This is equivalent to showing that
\[
P(E|\prod_{F\in\cgF_E}\overline{F})\le x(E)
\]

Suppose first that $\cgF_E\cap\cgN(E)=\emptyset$.  Then
\[
P(E|\prod_{F\in\cgF_E}\overline{F})=P(E)\le x(E).
\]
So we may assume that $\cgF_E\cap\cgN(E)\neq\emptyset$.  Let
$\cgF_E=\{F_1,F_2,F_r,F_{r+1},F_{r+2},\dots, F_t\}$, with
$F_i\in\cgN_E$ if and only if $r+1\le i\le t$.  Then

\[
PE|\prod_{F\in\cgF_E}\overline{F})=
 \frac{P(E\prod_{F\in\cgF_E\cap\cgN(E)}\overline{F}|\prod_{F\in\cgF_E-\cgN(E)}\overline{F})}
 {P(\prod_{F\in\cgF_E\cap \cgN(E)}\overline{F})}
\]

Consider first the numerator in this last expression.  Note that
\[
P(E\prod_{F\in\cgF_E\cap\cgN(E)}\overline{F}|\prod_{F\in\cgF_E-\cgN(E)}\overline{F})\le
P(E|\prod_{F\in\cgF_E\cap\cgN(E)}\overline{F})\le x(E)\prod_{F\in\cgF_E\cap\cgN(E)}(1-x(F))
\]
Next, consider the denominator.  By the inductive hypothesis, we have
\[
P(\prod_F\in\cgF_E\cap\cgN(E)\overline{F}\ge \prod_{F\in\cgF_E\cap\cgN(E)}(1-x(F)).
\] 
Combining these last two inequalities, we have
\[
P(E|\prod_{F\in\cgF_E}\overline{F})\le x(E)\prod_{\cgN(E)-\cgF_E}(1-x(F))\le x(E),
\]
and the proof is complete.
\end{proof}

Now here is the symmetric version.

\begin{lemma}[Lov\'asz Local Lemma]\label{lem:LLL-sym}
Let $p$ and $d$ be numbers with $0<p<1$ and $d\ge 1$.  Also,
let $\cgF$ be a finite family of events in a probability space 
and for each event $E\in\cgF$, let $\cgN(E)$ denote the 
subfamily of events from $\cgF-\{E\}$ so that $E$ is independent of 
any event not in $\cgN(E)$.  Suppose that $P(E)\le p$, $|\cgN(E)|\le d$ for 
every event $E\in\cgF$ and that $ep(d+1)<1$, where 
$e=2.71828\dots$ is the base for natural logarithms.  Then
Then
\[
P(\prod_{E\in\cgF}\overline{E})\ge\prod_{E\in\cgG}(1-x(E)),
\]
i.e., the probability that all events in $\cgF$ is positive.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Set $x(E)=1/(d+1)$ for every event $E\in\cgF$.  Then
\[
P(E)\le p\le \frac{1}{e(d+1)}\le x(E)\prod(F\in\cgN(E)(1-\frac{1}{d+1}).
\]
\end{proof}

A number of applications of the symmetric form of the Lov\'asz Local
Lemma are stated in terms of the condition that $4pd<1$.  The proof
of this alternate form is just a trivial modification of the argument
we have presented here.

\section{Applying the Local Lemma}

The list of applications of the Local Lemma has been growing
steadily, as has the interest in how the lemma can be applied
algorithmically, i.e., in a constructive setting.  But here
we present one of the early applications to Ramsey theory---estimating
the Ramsey number $(R,3,n)$.  Recall that we have the basic inequality 
$R(3,n)\le \binom{n+1}{3}$ from \autoref{thm:graphramsey}, and it is
natural to turn to the probabilistic method to look for good lower bounds.
But a few minutes thought shows that there are challenges to this
approach.

First, let's try a direct computation.  Suppose we try a random graph
on $t$ vertices with edge probability $p$.  So we would want no triangles,
and that would say we need $t^3p^3=1$, i.e., $p=1/t$.  Then we
would want no independent sets of size $n$, which would require
$n^te^{-pn^2}=1$, i.e., $t\ln n=pn^2$, so we can't even make
$t$ larger than $n$.  That's not helpful.

We can do a bit better by by allowing some triangles and then removing
one point from each, as was done in the proof for
\autoref{thm:girth}. Along these lines, we would
set $t^3p^3=t$, i.e., $p=t^{-2/3}$.  And the calculation now
yields the lower bound $R(3,n)\ge n^{6/5}/\ln^{-3/5} n$, so even
the exponent of $n$ is different from the upper bound.

So which one is right, or is the answer somewhere in between?
In a classic 1961 paper, Erd\H{o}s used a very clever application
of the probabilistic method to show the existence of a graph from
which a good lower bound could be extracted.  His technique
yielded the lower bound $R(3,n)\ge n^2/\ln^2 n$, so the two
on the exponent of $n$ is correct.

Here we will use the Lov\'asz Local Lemma to obtain this
same lower bound in a much more direct manner.  We consider
a random graph on $t$ vertices with edge probability $p$.
For each $3$-element subset $S$, we have the event $E_S$ which is
true when $S$ forms a triangle.  For each $n$-element set $T$, we have
the event $E_T$ which is true when $T$ is an independent set.  In
the discussion to follow, we abuse notation slightly and refer to
events $E_S$ and $E_T$ as just $S$ and $T$, respectively.  Note
that the probability of $S$ is $p^3$ for each $3$-element
set $S$, while the probability of $T$ is $q=(1-p)^{C(n,2)}\sim
e^{-pn^2/2}$ for each $n$-element set $T$.  

When we apply the Local Lemma, we will set $x=x(S)$ to be $e^2p^3$,
for each $3$-element set $S$.  And we will set $y=Y(T)=q^{1/2}\sim
e^{-pn^2/4}$.  It will be clear in a moment where we got those values.

Furthermore, the neighborhood of an event consists of all sets
in the family which have two or more elements in common.
So the neighborhood of a $3$-element set $S$ consists of $3(t-3)$ 
other $3$-element sets and $C(t-3,n-3)+3C(t-3,n-2)$ sets of size~$n$.  
Similarly, the neighborhood of an $n$-element set $T$ consists of $C(n,3)+
(t-n)C(n,2)$ sets of size $3$ and $\sum_{i=2}^{n-1}C(n,i)
C(t-n,n-i)$ other sets of size~$n$.  So the basic inequalities
we need to satisfy are:

\begin{align*}
p^3 \le & x(1-x)^{3(t-3)}(1-y)^{C(t-3,n-3)+3C(t-n,n-2)}\\
q \le & y(1-x)^{C(n,3)+(t-n)C(n,2)}(1-y)^{C(t-3,n-3)+3C(t-n,n-2)}\\
\end{align*}

Next, we assume that $n^{3/2}<t<n^2$ and then make the usual 
approximations, ignoring smaller order terms and multiplicative
constants, to see that these inequalities can be considered in 
the following simplified form:

\begin{align*}
p^3 \le & x(1-x)^{t}(1-y)^{t^n}\\
q \le & y(1-x)^{tn^2}(1-y)^{t^n}\\
\end{align*}

A moments reflection makes it clear that
we want to keep the terms involving
$(1-y)$ relatively large, i.e.,
at least $1/e$.  This will certainly be true if
we keep  $t^n\le 1/y$. This is equivalent
to $n\ln t\le pn^2$, or $\ln t\le pn$.

Similarly, we want to keep the term $(1-x)^{t}$ relatively large,
so we keep $t\le 1/x$, i.e., $t\le 1/p^3$.  On the other hand,
we want only to keep the term $(1-x)^{tn^2}\sim e^{-xtn^2}$ at least as large
as $y$.  This is equivalent to keeping
$p\le xt$, and since $x\sim p^3$, this can be rewritten as $p^{-1}\le t^{1/2}$.  

Now we have our marching orders.  We just set $\ln t=pn$ and
$p^{-1}=t^{1/2}$.  After substituting, we get $t= n^2/\ln^2t$ and
since $\ln t=\ln n$ (at least within the kind of approximations we
are using), we get the desired result $t=n^2/\ln^2n$.
